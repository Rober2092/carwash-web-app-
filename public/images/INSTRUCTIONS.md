# How to Add Your Car Photos

## Step 1: Get Your Car Photos Ready
You need 4 car photos (JPG, PNG, or WebP format).

## Step 2: Name Your Images
Rename your photos to:
- `car1.jpg` (or .png)
- `car2.jpg` (or .png)
- `car3.jpg` (or .png)
- `car4.jpg` (or .png)

## Step 3: Add to This Folder
Copy your renamed images into this folder:
```
/public/images/
```

## Step 4: Refresh Your Browser
Once you've added the images, refresh your browser at http://localhost:5174

The carousel will automatically display your photos!

**Note:** If you have fewer than 4 photos, that's okay! The carousel will work with however many you add. Just make sure they're named starting from `car1.jpg`.
